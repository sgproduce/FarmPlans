* You may receive extra birds to offset losses in shipping.  Plan accordingly
* Too much space is better than too little
* Have gradual temperature gradient in space to birds to adjust their own temperature
* Soiled dry litter reduces coccidosis
* Wet litter increases mold and mold related health issues
